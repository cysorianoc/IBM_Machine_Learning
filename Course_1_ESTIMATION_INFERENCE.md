# 📊 Module 4: Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing 

In this module, we explore **how to learn from data beyond mere description**, and make informed conclusions using **inferential statistics**. This includes understanding key distinctions like *estimation vs inference*, *parametric vs non-parametric models*, and *frequentist vs Bayesian frameworks*. We’ll also connect these concepts to **machine learning (ML)** with intuitive examples like **customer churn** and **earthquake prediction**.

## 🔍 Estimation vs Inference

| Concept     | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Estimation** | Calculates a quantity from data. | The average (mean) age of customers. |
| **Inference** | Quantifies uncertainty around estimates. | The 95% confidence interval of that average age. |

In **estimation**, we summarize the data: *What is the mean value?*

In **inference**, we ask: *How sure are we about this estimate?* This includes estimating error margins like **standard error**, constructing **confidence intervals**, and testing **hypotheses**.

> ⚠️ **Key Insight**: Estimation gives you a number. Inference tells you how much you can trust that number.

## 🤖 How This Relates to Machine Learning

In both **statistics** and **machine learning**, we try to understand patterns and structures in data.

| Goal | Statistics | Machine Learning |
|------|------------|------------------|
| Understanding relationships | Estimate effect sizes, test significance | Interpret model coefficients, feature importance |
| Prediction | Confidence intervals, regression models | Predict unseen data outcomes |

**Machine Learning** is often concerned with *prediction*, while **statistical inference** focuses on *interpretation*. However, modern ML tasks increasingly demand **explainable models**, making statistical inference more relevant than ever.

## 💼 Example: Customer Churn

Imagine you work at a telecom company and want to understand why customers leave ("churn").

### Estimation

We use historical data to **estimate**:
- Probability a customer will leave
- Impact of features (e.g. customer age, monthly bill)

> Example: Customers with tenure > 2 years are **20% less likely** to churn.

### Inference

We want to **infer** whether these estimates are **statistically significant**:
- 95% Confidence Interval: Reduction in churn probability is between 19% and 21%.
- This helps us make **data-driven decisions** (e.g., launch a loyalty program for newer customers).

## 🔢 Parametric vs Non-Parametric Models

### Parametric Models

- Assume a **specific form** for the data (e.g., normal distribution).
- Model has **fixed number of parameters** (e.g., mean, standard deviation).
- Example: **Linear Regression** assumes a straight-line relationship.

> **Pros**: Efficient with small data, interpretable.  
> **Cons**: Can be wrong if assumptions don’t hold.

### Non-Parametric Models

- **No fixed assumptions** about the data distribution.
- Can adapt to more flexible shapes (e.g., decision trees, histograms).
- Example: **Kernel Density Estimation**, or using **random forests** in ML.

> **Pros**: Fewer assumptions, flexible.  
> **Cons**: Require more data, harder to interpret.

## 📈 Example: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

To estimate CLV (how much revenue a customer will bring over time), we might:

- Use a **parametric approach**: Assume spending follows a linear or log-normal trend.
- Use a **non-parametric approach**: Rely directly on historical spending patterns using machine learning.

## 🎯 Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

MLE is the go-to method for estimating parameters in parametric models.

> **Idea**: Find the parameters (e.g., mean, std) that **maximize the probability** of observing your actual data.

### Example:
Suppose customer purchases follow a **normal distribution**.  
MLE helps us find the **mean** and **standard deviation** that best describe the observed purchase data.

## 📊 Commonly Used Distributions

| Distribution | Use Case | Example |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| **Uniform** | Equal chance across range | Rolling a fair die |
| **Normal** | Bell-shaped, many natural phenomena | Heights, IQ scores |
| **Log-Normal** | Skewed data, positive-only | Income, sales volume |
| **Exponential** | Time between events | Waiting time for next earthquake |
| **Poisson** | Count of events in a time period | Number of support tickets per hour |

---

## 🌍 Earthquakes: A Didactic Example

### Exponential Distribution (Waiting Time)

> **Question**: How long until the next big quake?

If quakes are random but average once every 50 years, the **Exponential distribution** models time between them. Short waits are more probable; long waits are rare—but possible.

### Poisson Distribution (Counting Events)

> **Question**: How many big quakes in the next 100 years?

If the average is 2 per century, Poisson helps estimate:
- P(0 quakes) = ?
- P(1 quake) = ?
- P(2 quakes) = highest
- P(3+ quakes) = lower probabilities

## 🎲 Frequentist vs Bayesian Thinking

| Feature | Frequentist | Bayesian |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Probability is... | Long-run frequency | Degree of belief |
| Parameters are... | Fixed, unknown | Random variables |
| Uses... | Data only | Prior + Data |
| Output | Point estimate, CI | Posterior distribution |

### Analogy: Diagnosing a Disease

- **Frequentist**: "If I test 1000 people, how many will test positive?"
- **Bayesian**: "Given a positive result, how likely is it that this person actually has the disease?"

> Bayesian methods are **dynamic** and useful when prior knowledge is important (e.g., small data situations, continual learning in ML).

## 🤝 Summary: How All This Links with Machine Learning

| Statistical Concept | ML Connection |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Estimation | Model coefficients, predictions |
| Inference | Confidence in predictions, feature importance |
| Parametric models | Logistic/linear regression |
| Non-parametric models | Decision trees, SVMs, neural networks |
| MLE | Loss minimization in training |
| Frequentist | Traditional ML training (e.g., empirical risk minimization) |
| Bayesian | Bayesian networks, probabilistic programming, uncertainty quantification |

> 🎯 **Key Takeaway**: Machine learning builds upon the foundations of statistical inference. Understanding how we estimate, infer, and interpret parameters is essential for building robust, interpretable, and responsible AI systems.
